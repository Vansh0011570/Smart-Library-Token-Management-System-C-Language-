A lightweight, command-line-based library token management system that simulates RFID-style logic to automate book issue-return cycles in a smart library setup. This project is built using pure C language, emphasizing data structures and file handling without any external libraries.

Project Overview:
This system allows:
Student registration
Book issuing (up to 3 books per student)
Book return with fine calculation (after 14 days)
Data stored using file handling
CLI-based interface

Key Concepts Used:
Structures to store student and book info
File handling for persistent data
Arrays and loops for record management
Date logic for fine calculation
Functions for modular code

 Core Features in Code:
âœ… Student can:
Register
View available books
Issue book (max 3)
Return book (calculate fine if >14 days)

Tech Stack
- Language: C (GCC compatible)
- Concepts: Arrays and pointer , Structures, Functions, Date Handling
- Optional Add-on: File I/O for persistence (can be extended)
- Core Concepts, Menu-driven Programming,Tokenization & Unique ID Logic
